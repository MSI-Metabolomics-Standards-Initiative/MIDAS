###Workflow Diagram of Pretreatment Phase of Data Analysis
<!--Below you will be instructed to enter the steps of the pretreatment phase of analysis so that they will become nodes of your workflow diagram. You will also be asked to differentiate between the different datasets at each point -->

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
grViz("
  digraph boxes_and_circles{
  


  node [shape = box]
###Instruction 1: write out all steps of pretreatment in your analysis as below separated by semicolon, delete or add to this list as appropriate

  Imputation; Normalisation; Scaling; Filtering; QC_Treatment;

  node [shape =  circle]

### Instruction 2: Write out all datasets inputs and outputs and all biomarker lists created at the pretreatment stage, include the dimensions of the input and output datasets in the name, in the following format...dataset#_NxM, where # is the unique identifier of the dataset which is the input or output at that point in the analysis, where N is the number of samples (rows) in the dataset and where m is the number of variables or peaks (columns) in the dataset at that point in the analysis. Delete or add to this list as appropriate


  Dataset1_15x4000; Dataset2_100x3500; BiomarkerList1;
 
### Connect all nodes of the workflow diagram including the dataset inputs and outputs as steps in the diagram, as below 

Dataset1_15x4000->QC_Treatment; 

QC_Treatment-> Dataset2_100x3500;

###Workflow Diagram of all major steps of the Data Analysis




```{r  echo=FALSE}

### This will give all the steps of the analysis a box shape in your diagram

node [shape = box]

### Instruction 3: Write out all steps of the analysis as below separated by semicolon

Pretreatment; Univariate_Analysis; Supervised_Analysis; Unsupervised_Analysis;ROC_Analysis;



### This will give all the datasets and biomarker lists entering and resulting from the analysis a circle shape in your diagram

node [shape = circle]

### Instruction 4: Write out all datasets inputs and outputs and all biomarker lists created at the pretreatment stage, include the dimensions of the input and output datasets in the name, in the following format...dataset#_NxM, where # is the unique identifier of the dataset which is the input or output at that point in the analysis, where N is the number of samples (rows) in the dataset and where m is the number of variables or peaks (columns) in the dataset at that point in the analysis.

###Instruction 5: Connect the nodes with edges by using an arrow in the following way
